# From Nvim to VSCode
This is little script convert your lua remap to VSCode format. 
It obviously don't work for all formats, but for basic remaps can be quite useful.

## Creating reason
I mainly use nvim and really like it, but for some use cases it just doesn't work.
For me it is using jupyter notebooks, there are generally no good approach for editing notebooks in nvim.
I tried many different things, but all of them not even close to experience I would like to have.
So I decided to make some pipeline for moving my nvim habits to vscode for some use cases.
In this rep I would like to store all little script that help me move nvim configs (it is source of thhe truth for me)
to vscode vim plugin. If it interesting to you, write issue and request features.
